</div>

This is a BentoML example project, showing you how to serve and deploy open-source Large Language Models using [LMDeploy](https://github.com/InternLM/lmdeploy), a toolkit for compressing, deploying, and serving LLM.

See [here](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-what-you-can-build-with-bentoml) for a full list of BentoML example projects.

ðŸ’¡ This example is served as a basis for advanced code customization, such as custom model, inference logic or LMDeploy options. For simple LLM hosting with OpenAI compatible endpoint without writing any code, see [OpenLLM](https://github.com/bentoml/OpenLLM).


## Prerequisites

- You have installed Python 3.8+ and `pip`. See the [Python downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to learn more.
- You have a basic understanding of key concepts in BentoML, such as Services. We recommend you read [Quickstart](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/1.2/get-started/quickstart.html) first.
- If you want to test the Service locally, you need a Nvidia GPU with at least 20G VRAM.
- (Optional) We recommend you create a virtual environment for dependency isolation for this project. See the [Conda documentation](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) or the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for details.

## Install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bentoml/BentoLMDeploy.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Download the model

```bash
python import_model.py
```

## Run the BentoML Service

We have defined a BentoML Service in `service.py`. RunÂ `bentomlÂ serve`Â in your project directory to start the Service.

```bash
$ bentoml serve .

The server is now active atÂ [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/). You can interact with it using the Swagger UI or in other different ways.

  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \

```python
import bentoml

with bentoml.SyncHTTPClient("http://localhost:3000") as client:
    response_generator = client.generate(

    )
    for response in response_generator:
        print(response)
```

## Deploy to BentoCloud

After the Service is ready, you can deploy the application to BentoCloud for better management and scalability. [Sign up](https://www.bentoml.com/) if you haven't got a BentoCloud account.

Make sure you have [logged in to BentoCloud](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/latest/bentocloud/how-tos/manage-access-token.html), then run the following command to deploy it.

```bash
bentoml deploy .
```

Once the application is up and running on BentoCloud, you can access it via the exposed URL.

**Note**: For custom deployment in your own infrastructure, use [BentoML to generate an OCI-compliant image](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/latest/guides/containerization.html).


## Different LLM Models

Besides the mistral-7b-instruct model, we have examples for other models in subdirectories of this repository. Below is a list of these models and links to the example subdirectories.

- [Llama-2-7b-chat-hf](llama2-7b-chat/)
- [Llama-3-8b-instruct](llama3-8b-instruct/)
- [Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2](mistral-7b-instruct/)
- [Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1 with gptq quantization](mistral-7b-instruct/)
- [Outlines integration](outlines-integration/)
- [SOLAR-10.7B-v1.0](solar-10.7b-instruct/)


## LLM tools integration examples

- Every model directory contains codes to add OpenAI compatible endpoints to the BentoML service.
- [outlines-integration/](outlines-integration/) contains the code to integrate with [outlines](https://github.com/outlines-dev/outlines) for structured generation.
